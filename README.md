This is the final project I did for IoT & Web programming course. It is made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

This program is getting data from my school's small weather station and presents it on a website. Latest values page presents 50 of the latest values. Temperature
page presents 20 of the latest temperature values in a graph and also statistics such as mean and median. Humidity page presents the same data but with humidity values.
